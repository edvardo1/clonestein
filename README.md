this is just a school project that showcases a simple (yet inefficient)
raycaster to display a maze.

controls:
    move the phone left or right to turn left or right (uses the gyroscope)
    touch any part of the screen to move the character forwards

if you get stuck, just go back the same direction you came from, the collision
resolution is not very good so you can get stuck quite often.
